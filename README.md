# TQ-pre-jailbreak

A **PRE**-jailbreak for iOS 14.0 ~ iOS 14.3 on all devices.

Generally speaking, jailbreak starts from an arbitrary kernel r/w vulnerability, so I name it pre-jailbreak. Actually, CVE-2021-1782(cicuta\_virosa) is the pre-jailbreak thing.

Implemented an arbitrary r/w primitive based on [cicuta\_virosa](https://github.com/ModernPwner/cicuta_virosa). Useful to security researchers, and jailbreak developers.

# Warranty

**Use it on your own risk**. I build it for security researchers only. **MEAN NOTHING** to normal user.

**DO NOT RUN IT** on you main device. I can not promise **WHAT WILL HAPPEN!**

# Current state

- [x] stable kernel r/w primitives
- [x] ~~amfid bypass~~ Implement it by yourself. Bad guys could use this to distribute malicious code directly.

Tested on iPhone 12 pro (**iOS 14.3**).

Tested on iPhone 11 (**iOS 14.0 and iOS 14.2**).

Tested on iPhone 6s (**iOS 14.0**). Maybe helpful to A11 devices. I note that checkra1n said "Limited support for A11 devices on iOS 14.x".

For other devices/iOSs, add kernel offsets yourself in k\_offsets.c
